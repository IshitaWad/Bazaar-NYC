# Bazaar: Your City's Living Room 🏙️

## Problem
- Over 18% of Manhattan’s office space is now vacant — a historic high since before COVID.
- Only ~67% of pre-pandemic traffic in many office buildings — meaning many offices are significantly underused.
- Zoning laws limit conversions: until recently only older buildings (pre-1961 or 1977) in certain districts could be converted; newer laws are expanding eligibility up to pre-1990 buildings.
- Even with tax incentives like the 467-m program, conversion requires affordable housing quotas, specific deadlines, and regulatory compliance — making many conversions non-feasible or costly.
